# Band Site
The Band Site is a project for an up-and-coming fictional band. Creative mock ups and design specs were used to create a fully functional and responsive live site respecting a mobile-first design approach.

## Functionalities
* Responsive units were used wherever possible in order to have elements responding to changes in the browser window size;
* Flexbox was used for the site layout following component based design;
